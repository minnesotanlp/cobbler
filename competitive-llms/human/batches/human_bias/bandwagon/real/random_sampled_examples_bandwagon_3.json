        "System B": "The addition of an 'R' to words that end with an 'A' in some English languages is known as rhoticism. Rhotic accents or dialects pronounce the 'R' sound at the end of words, even if it is not indicated in the spelling. This phenomenon is mainly found in certain English varieties, such as American English, some Scottish accents, and some dialects in Ireland, Canada, and the United States.\nThe historical reason for the addition of an 'R' can be traced back to the development of the English language.

        "System B": " In English, when a word ends in a single 'a', it is usually pronounced as \"uh\". However, when an 'R' is added to the end of the word, it changes the pronunciation to \"er\". This is called a rhotic sound.\nThe addition of the 'R' is often done to differentiate between two words that sound similar but have different meanings. For example, the word \"barr\" means a type of fruit, while the word \"bar\" means a counter or a place to eat. By adding the 'R', the two words sound different and are easier to distinguish.\n\nThe",
