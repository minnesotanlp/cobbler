        "reference": "I'm no scientist, but this is eli5 and there is no response yet, so i'll wing it: water attenuates light. That is, the layer of water on your head doesn't reflect as much light as it would normally (dry), because not as much reflected light reaches your eye as it would when it's dry.\n\nEdit: It got me thinking, so i had to verify my own suspicion... I measured the reflectance of my own wet hair relative to it being dry. It's a little noisy as i spent maybe 30 seconds setting it up, and it's far from ideal, but I think this cooroborates what i postulate. ()[_URL_0_]",

        "System A": " When hair is wet, the water swells and thickens the shaft of each strand of hair. As a result, more light is absorbed instead of reflected, which causes hair to appear darker.",
        "System B": " The color of your hair is determined by the amount of melanin in your hair follicles.  When your hair is dry, melanin absorbs light, which makes your hair appear darker.  When your hair is wet, the melanin is suspended in water, which makes it less able to absorb light.  As a result, your hair appears lighter when it's wet.I am a software engineer and I love to solve problems. I am passionate about technology and I love learning new things.
