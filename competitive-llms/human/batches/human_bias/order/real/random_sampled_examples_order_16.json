My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash.

This could lead to the development of a fetish for that specific item or feeling.

For example, if an object or situation was present during a person's first sexual experience or during an intense sexual experience, they may associate that object or situation with sexual arousal.\n\n2.
